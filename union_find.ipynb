    "\n",
    "- Assume we have a set of villages in map, and there is no way between any two villages at initial, which means each village is isolated from other villages. We give the definition of “village a is connected to village b” for this problem as follow:\n",
    "- If village a is connected to village b, then village b is also connected to village a. That means a connection is symmetric.\n",
    "- If village a is connected to village b, and village b is connected to village c, then we say that village a is also connected to village c. That means a connection is transitive.\n",
    "- Each time, we can build a road to connect any two villages if they are not connected. Based on this situation, it comes with a few problems to be resolved:\n",
    "- We want to know how many disjoint components exist after some conecting operations.\n",
    "- We want to know which village belongs to which disjoint component efficiently.\n",
    "- Given any two villages, we need to know if they are connected.\n",
